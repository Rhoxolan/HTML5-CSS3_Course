    <h1>Computer programming</h1>

    <hr>

    <p><i>The free encyclopedia</i></p>

    <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer
        program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
        generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation
        of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a
        program is written in one or more languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions
        that will automate the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of
        programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application
        domain,
        specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

    <h2>History</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the
        automata of Al-Jazari were programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various
        rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could produce entirely
        different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with
        holes punched in them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician
        Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers,
        intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Women would continue
        to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable
        form. Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to 
        be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the 
        IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the first 
        electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced 
        in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer 
        memory.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular 
        machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer
        specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation
        code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little
        more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets
        also have different assembly languages. Kathleen Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in
        1950 for various computers at Birkbeck College.

    <h2>Modern programming</h2>

    <h3>Quality requirements</h3>

    <p>
        Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. 
        The following properties are among the most important:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
            algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management
            (e.g., buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as 
            incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system 
            services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose 
            or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. 
            This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, 
            cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program can be
            compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms,
            including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability
            of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make
            improvements or customizations, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good practices[24]
            during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end
            user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such
            as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes careful
            management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory leaks.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Readability of source code</h3>

    <p>
        In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow,
        and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly
        maintainability.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying 
        existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated
        code. A study[25] found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to
        understand it.
