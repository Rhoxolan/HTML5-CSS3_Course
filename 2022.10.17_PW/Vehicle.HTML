    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><a href="#ref1">[1];</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo.
        Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams),
        watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters)
        and spacecraft.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2];</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled,
        tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles
        types, terms and definitions.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3];</a></sup>
