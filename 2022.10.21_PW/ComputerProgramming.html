    <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer
        program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
        generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation
        of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a 
        program is written in one or more languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions 
        that will automate the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of 
        programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, 
        specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
